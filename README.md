# Sensa Emoji
Free, vector, and open-source emoji set

👋 Emoji is our common language. It crosses borders, countries, and dialects. 

🙀 However, the ones we use on a day-to-day basis are owned by corporations such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter, or Google, which leaves us with no free alternative that adapts to any communication format.

👩‍💻 So we have worked hard to create a growing set that you can use today in your brands, products, and presentations → https://sensa.co/emoji
